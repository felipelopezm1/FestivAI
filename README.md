Project Overview: 

Festiv-AI is a personalised advertising system for music festivals that leverages Generative AI to automatically create customised promotional posters for each individual.
By combining AI-powered text generation and Python automation, Festiv-AI produces a wide variety of unique ads by dynamically assembling artist images, festival backgrounds, and personalised messaging and schedules. 
This allows festivals to generate hundreds of tailored ads at scale, improving audience engagement and promoting young and new artists, while significantly reducing manual design effort.
